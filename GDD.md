## Introduction

### Capstone
This is a companion app for our Capstone project. We are making a 3D Sidescroller with puzzle elements in Unity where you do not control protagonist at all. Instead, you manipulate UI Elements and objects scattered in the scene in order to protect your the character and help him defeat the enemies in the level. 

### Purpose
The aim of this companion app is to provide players of our Capstone game with more information on our project. Weâ€™re thinking of a game wiki with some extra features. The app will supplement our Capstone presentation and allow anybody to read more about our team, view concept art, and learn more about the game at their own pace. It will also provide people with an interactive way to read about characters using AR technology.

## Project Scope
We will have a menu system that allows the user to easily navigate between different pages, including character biographies, lore, a world map and game tips. There will be a section for character and concept art, as well a development page with live updates from our professional social media account(s). Augmented Reality will be used to project images of character sprites onto a nearby surface and display information about them. Finally, we aim to incorporate networking components in the form of stat tracking and global leaderboards. 

## Product Perspective
The product is meant to supplement our Capstone presentation by providing people an interactive way to learn more about the world that Dunga the Chosen takes place in.
